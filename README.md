# Airbnb Singapore Listings - Dashboard

## Problem Statement

The objective of this dashboard is to furnish Airbnb Singapore with comprehensive insights into the spectrum of available accommodation types across the region, coupled with their average pricing and occupancy rates throughout the year 2022. The primary goal is to discern the key factors influencing occupancy rates and identify any underserved regions. This information is crucial for strategic host recruitment efforts, specifically targeting regions with untapped potential, ultimately aiming to maximize revenue for Airbnb Singapore.

# Insights

Following inferences can be drawn from the dashboard;

### [1] Central Region's Competition Dynamics:
The central region emerges as highly competitive, hosting the majority of listings (61.71%). Interestingly, despite the abundance of listings, it exhibits the lowest average occupancy rate. This inverse relationship between the number of listings and occupancy rates suggests that high competition in the central region may be impacting hosts' success, resulting in lower occupancy rates.


### [2] Underserved Potential in North-East and East Regions:
The North-East and East regions, with only 2.65% and 4.11% of the listings respectively, present an untapped opportunity. Despite their relatively high average prices (161.08 3rd highest average price out of 5 regions and 187.30 - 2nd highest average price out of 5 regions), both regions boast the highest occupancy rates. To meet the demand, Airbnb Singapore should consider targeted host recruitment efforts in these underserved areas, potentially leveraging location-based marketing.

### [3] Leveraging Guest Feedback for Increased Occupancy:

Examining the key influencer chart reveals an interesting correlation between the number of listings a host has (specifically in the range of 100-140 and 23-36) and increased occupancy rates. However, since the number of listings is beyond a host's control, being dependent on the properties they own, the focal point for enhancing occupancies should shift towards the number of reviews. Notably, a compelling trend emerges as the number of reviews exceeds 15, showing a positive relationship with higher occupancy rates. This underscores the importance of guest feedback, suggesting that Airbnb can collaboratively work with hosts to optimize this factor and potentially influence booking decisions positively.
